# About Me
I'm currently in my first year of Honors Mathematics at the University of Waterloo and have a strong interest in machine learning ðŸ¤– and algorithmic trading :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I'm currently working on building a neural network from scratch and adding the finishing touches to a few other interesting projects. Feel free to reach out!
